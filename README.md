DHS Myanmar R-package Planning
================

# What are we going to do?

the r-package, which automatically calculates the DHS report indicators

# What will our work plan look like?

1.  First, we all need to review our R skills through some review
    sessions (basic command, looping, and function development)
2.  Then, go for sharing session about how to write r-package with one
    sample DHS function.
3.  And study the DHS methodology, indicators, and questionnaires.
4.  Finally, we can start writing our package.

# What is our project timeline?

Up to how many DHS chapters we can finish writing function - there is no
strict timeline. But, as a tentative goal, we need to release something
usable package with coverage of 3 or 4 modules (DHS report chapters)
before 2023. The initial preparation might take some time (to go through
the first three steps), and we need to decide how weekly we will meet to
work on those steps and when.
